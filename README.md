# Image_Edge_Detection
تشخيص لبه هاي تصوير و از بين بردن نويز

 #Introduction:
 
 My project is related to the detection of image edges and removing image noise with the help of programming codes
 
 main.m:
 
 This file is derived from the original codes that we can run in MATLAB and other programs.
 
 line.m:
 
 This file is derived from codes and a series of tricks in programming
 
 image.m:
 
 We have used three images in this folder to test the coding and in these images we find the edges of the image and remove their noises.

 Main article:
 
 In our main article, there have been many discussions about how to remove image noises and identify the edges of the image and create a clear image for the viewer, and a series of functions and formulas have been used to prove this claim.
